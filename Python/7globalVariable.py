# ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Global Variables~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ #
# Variables that are created outside of a function (as in all of the examples above) are known as global variables.
# Global variables can be used by everyone, both inside of functions and outside.

# Example: Create a veriable outside of a function, and use it inside the function
x = "awesome"
def myfunc():
    print("Python is " + x)
myfunc()

# Normally, when you create a variable inside a function, that variable is local, and can only be used inside that function.
# To creatte a globel variable inside a function, you can use the global keyword.

def myfunc():
    global x
    x = "fantastic"

myfunc()
print("Python is " + x)

# To change the value of a global variable inside a function, refer to the variable by using the global keyword:
x = "awesome"

def myfunc():
  global x
  x = "fantastic"

myfunc()

print("Python is " + x)
